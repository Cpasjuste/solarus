Loads a Lua file (but does not run it).

Remarks
    Keep in mind that Lua files, as all data files of your quest, may be located inside an archive instead of being regular files. Therefore, to run them, you cannot use usual Lua functions like `loadfile()` or `dofile()`. Use [sol.main.load_file()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html#lua_api_main_load_file) and [sol.main.do_file()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html#lua_api_main_do_file) instead to let Solarus determine how to locate and open the file.
     Note however that `require()` can be used normally because it is a higher-level function. Indeed, a specific loader is automatically set by the engine so that `require()` looks in the archive if necessary and in the quest write directory. `require()` is the recommended way to load code from another file, because unlike [sol.main.load_file()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html#lua_api_main_load_file) and [sol.main.do_file()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html#lua_api_main_do_file), it does not parses the file again every time you call it.

        get_metatable = {
          type = "function",
          description = [[

Returns the metatable of a Solarus userdata type.

This function is very powerful and should be used with care.

All userdata objects of a type share the same metatable. So there is a metatable for maps, a metatable for games, a metatable for enemies, etc.

The metatable of a type stores what is common to all instances of this type. For example, the metatable of the `"enemy"` type has a field `"get_life"` that is the Solarus function [enemy:get_life()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_get_life) shared by all enemies.

Note that you can already get the metatable of any object with the standard Lua function `getmetatable(object)`. This function does the same thing, except that you don't have to provide an existing object: you just provide a type name. This allows you do manipulate the metatable of a type before objects of this type start to exist, typically to set up things before a game is started.

You can use the metatable to add a function to all instances of a type. Thus, you can extend the Solarus API with your own functions. This also work for events (functions that the engine automatically calls when they exist). For example, you can easily provide a function `add_overlay()` to all your maps by defining it only once in the map metatable:
    
    
    -- Somewhere in your main script, at initialization time:
    
    local map_metatable = sol.main.get_metatable("map")
    function map_metatable:add_overlay(image_file_name)
      -- Here, self is the map.
      self.overlay = sol.surface.create(image_file_name)
    end
    
    function map_metatable:on_draw(dst_surface)
      if self.overlay ~= nil then
        self.overlay:draw(dst_surface)
      end
    end
    
    -- Now, all your maps will have a function map:add_overlay() and an event
    -- map:on_draw() that allows to draw an additional image above the map!
    

When you define a field in a metatable, everything acts like if you defined it in all existing and future instances of the type. However, an individual instance is still able to define a field with the same name. In this case, the instance has the priority: the field from the metatable is overridden.

Similarly, you can even remove (by assigning `nil`) or modify (by assigning a new value) any function of the Solarus API. We don't recommend to do this because introducing differences with the official API changes the global behavior. It would be unexpected for other people who contribute to your game, and for people you share your scripts with.

  * `type_name` (string): Name of a Solarus userdata Lua type (see the list of types in [sol.main.get_type()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html#lua_api_main_get_type) above).
  * Return value (table): The metatable of this type, or `nil` if there is no such Solarus type.



Remarks
    If you are a Lua expert, you know that metatables are a very powerful mechanism. They are where the magic happens. Solarus uses metatables internally to do a lot of things, like allowing you to access userdata as tables. Therefore, you should never touch any metamethod (fields whose name starts with two underscores) in the metatable of a userdata type, in particular `__index`, `__newindex` and `__gc`.

It is recommended to call this function at the beginning of the program (typically from [sol.main:on_started()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html#lua_api_main_on_started)).

The list of sound files to load is read from the [quest database](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/quest_database_file.html) file.

This function does nothing if you already called it before.

Plays a music.

If the music does not exist, a Lua error is generated.

Only one music can be played at a time. If the same music was already playing, it continues normally and does not restart. If a different music was already playing, it is stopped and replaced by the new one.

When the music reaches the end, the `action` parameter indicates what to do next. The default behavior is to loop from the beginning.

However, some music files already have their own loop internal loop information. Such musics are able to loop to a specific point rather than to the beginning. Since they already loop forever internally, they don't have an end and the `action` parameter has no effect on them. See [Music loop settings](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/quest_musics.html#quest_musics_loop) to know how Solarus supports internal loop information for each format.

  * `music_id` (string): Name of the music file to play, relative to the `musics` directory and without extension. The following extensions will be tried in this order: ```.ogg`, ```.it` and ```.spc`. `nil` stops playing any music (the second parameter has no effect in this case). If you set the music name to the same music that is already playing, or to the special value `"same"`, then this function does nothing: the music keeps playing (it does not restart) and the second parameter is ignored.
  * `action` (function or boolean, optional): What to do when the music finishes (reaches its end). A boolean value indicates whether or not the music should loop. The default is `true`. A function value indicates a custom action (and implies no loop). It will be called when the music finishes. This allows you to perform an action of your choice, like playing another music.

`sol.video` allows you to manage the window and the display.

The area where the game takes place has a fixed size called the quest size. The quest size is in a range specified in the [quest properties file](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/quest_properties_file.html). This quest size is the logical size: it determines how much content the player can see on the map.

The quest size is typically 320x240 pixels, but some systems may prefer other sizes, like 400x240 on Android. You can set a range of supported quest sizes in the quest properties files for portability. However, it requires more work on your part: in particular, you have to implement menus and a HUD that can adapt to any size in this range. And be aware that some players will be able to see more game content than others.

The quest can be played in windowed mode or in fullscreen. In windowed mode, the window can be resized by the user or by your scripts. The quest size is independent from the actual window size: when you resize the window, the quest image is scaled to fit the window. The pixel ratio is always preserved, possibly by adding black borders.

Solarus supports OpenGL shaders to modify the rendering, for example to apply a smoothing filter. See the [shader](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_shader.html) documentation for more details.

      description = [[

To display various information such as a title screen, a dialog box, a HUD (head-up display) or a pause screen, you can use one or several menus.

A menu is an arbitrary Lua table. A menu belongs to a context that may be the current [map](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html), the current [game](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html), the [sol.main](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html) table or even another menu. This context is the lifetime of your menu. As long as your menu is active, the engine will call events that are defined in your table, i.e. callback methods like [menu:on_started()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html#lua_api_menu_on_started) [menu:on_draw()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html#lua_api_menu_on_draw), [menu:on_key_pressed()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html#lua_api_menu_on_key_pressed), etc., to notify your menu of something (the player pressed a key, your menu needs to be redrawn, etc.).

This menu API does not provide anything fundamental: indeed, the [map](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html), [game](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html) and [sol.main](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html) APIs already provide the necessary features, so you could do what you want from there manually. But the API described on this page makes your life easier because menus automatically receive events whenever they need to be notified, and automatically stop being active when their context no longer exists.

Starts a menu in a context.

  * `context` ([map](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html), [game](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html) or table): The context your menu will belong to. Similarly to the case of [timers](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_timer.html), the context determines the lifetime of your menu. The context must be one of the following four objects:
    * If you make a [map](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html) menu, your menu will be drawn above the map surface. It will be stopped when the player goes to another map. This may be useful to show head-up information local to a precise map.  
Example: a counter or a mini-game that only exists on a specific map.  

    * If you make a [game](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html) menu, your menu will be global to all maps. As long as the game is running, it will persist accross map changes.  
Example: the player's life counter.  

    * If you make a [main](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html) menu, your menu will be global to the whole program. It can exist outside a game (and it even persists during the game if you don't stop it).  
Example: the title screen.
    * If you set the context to another menu, then its lifetime will be limited to this other menu. This allows to make nested menus. Example: a popup that shows some information above another menu.
    * `menu` (table): The menu to activate. It can be any table. The only thing that makes it special is the presence of callback functions (events) as described in section [Events of a menu](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html#lua_api_menu_events).
  * `on_top` (boolean, optional): Whether this menu should be drawn on top of other existing menus of the same context or behind them. If `true`, the [on_draw()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html#lua_api_menu_on_draw) event of your menu will be the last to be called if there are several menus in the context.

Shorter version to do the same thing:
    
    
    -- Equivalent code using an anonymous function.
    sol.timer.start(1000, function()
      sol.audio.play_sound("secret")
    end)
    

You can repeat a timer by returning `true` from your function:
    
    
    -- Call a function every second.
    sol.timer.start(1000, function()
      sol.audio.play_sound("danger")
      return true  -- To call the timer again (with the same delay).
    end)
    

To make a timer that repeats itself 10 times, just return `false` after 10 calls:
    
    
    -- Call a function ten times, with one second between each call.
    local num_calls = 0
    sol.timer.start(1000, function()
      sol.audio.play_sound("danger")
      num_calls = num_calls + 1
      return num_calls < 10
    end)
    

It is possible to restrict the lifetime of a timer to a context, like the game, the map or an enemy:
    
    
    -- Enemy that shoots a fireball every 5 seconds until it is killed.
    sol.timer.start(your_enemy, 5000, function()
      sol.audio.play_sound("attack_fireball")
      map:create_enemy(...)  -- Code that creates the fireball.
      return true  -- Repeat the timer.
    end)
    

Setting the context to an enemy ensures that when the enemy is killed, the timer is canceled. Otherwise, the callback function would still be called: in this example, you would hear the `"attack_fireball"` sound and the fireball would be created even if the enemy is killed in the meantime.

  * `context` ([map](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html), [game](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html), [item](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_item.html), [map entity](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html), [state](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_state.html), [menu](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html) or [sol.main](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html); optional): Determines the lifetime of the timer. The context is where the timer belongs.  
If the context gets closed before the timer is finished, then the timer is automatically canceled. More precisely, the following rules are applied.
    * If you set the context to a [map](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html), the timer is canceled when the player goes to another map.  
Example: a button that opens a door for a limited time.
    * If you set the context to a [game](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html) or an [item](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_item.html), the timer is canceled when the game is closed. (Items have the same lifetime as the game they belong to.) This is only possible when the game is running. Example: hot water that becomes cold after a few minutes, and that the player should bring to an NPC on another map while it's still hot.
    * If you set the context to a [map entity](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html), the timer is canceled when the entity is removed from the map. In the case of an enemy, the timer is also canceled when the enemy is hurt, immobilized or restarts. Also note that while the entity is suspended, the timer is also suspended. An entity may be suspended when the [game is suspended](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_is_suspended), or when the entity is [disabled](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_set_enabled).  
Example: a boss who shoots fireballs every 10 seconds. Most enemy scripts usually create timers.
    * If you set the context to a [state](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_state.html), the timer is canceled when the custom hero state finishes or when the hero is removed. Like entity timers, state timers get suspended when the hero is suspended. Example: charging an attack during 3 seconds in a custom state.
    * If you set the context to a [menu](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html), the timer is canceled when the menu is closed.  
Example: in the title screen, show some animations after a few seconds without action from the user.
    * If you set the context to the [sol.main](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html) table, the timer is canceled when Lua is closed. Thus, it will be a global timer. This kind of timer is not often needed.  
Example: dumping some global information periodically while the program is running.
    * If you don't specify a context, then a default context is set for you: the current [map](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html) during a [game](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html), and [sol.main](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html) if no game is running.
  * `delay` (number): Delay before calling the function in milliseconds.
  * `callback` (function): The function to be called when the timer finishes. If this callback function returns `true`, then the timer automatically repeats itself with the same delay. In this case, if the delay is shorter than the time of a cycle of the main loop, the callback may be executed several times in the same cycle in order to catch up.
  * Return value (timer): The timer created. Most of the time, you don't need to store the returned timer. Indeed, there is no problem if it gets garbage-collected: the timer persists in the engine side until its completion or the end of its context. Usually, you will store the return value only if you need to stop the timer explicitly later or to call another method on it.



Remarks
    When they are created, [map](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html) timers, [map entity](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html) timers and [item](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_item.html) timers are initially suspended if a dialog is active. After that, they get automatically suspended and unsuspended when the map is suspended or unsuspended. This default behavior is suited for most use cases, but if you want to change it, you can use [timer:set_suspended()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_timer.html#lua_api_timer_set_suspended) and [timer:set_suspended_with_map()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_timer.html#lua_api_timer_set_suspended_with_map).

This function is equivalent to calling [timer:stop()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_timer.html#lua_api_timer_stop) on each timer of the context. It may allow you to avoid to store explicitly all your timers.

Remarks
    Canceling timers by hand may be tedious and error-prone. In lots of cases, you can simply pass a context parameter to [sol.timer.start()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_timer.html#lua_api_timer_start) in order to restrict the lifetime of your timer to some other object.

There are several types of movements. They differ by the kind of trajectory they can make. When you create a movement, you obtain a value of the movement type you chose. Then, to get and set its properties (like the speed, the angle, etc.), a movement object has several methods available. As detailed below, the methods available differ depending on the movement type because all movement types don't have the same properties.

The following movement types are available.

  * [Straight movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_straight_movement.html): Rectilinear trajectory in any direction.
  * [Random movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_random_movement.html): A straight movement whose direction changes randomly from time to time.
  * [Target movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_target_movement.html): Straight trajectory towards a possibly moving target.
  * [Path movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_path_movement.html): Predetermined path composed of steps in the 8 main directions.
  * [Random path movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_random_path_movement.html): Like a path movement, but with random steps.
  * [Path finding movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_path_finding_movement.html): Like a path movement, but calculated to reach a possibly moving target.
  * [Circle movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_circle_movement.html): Circular trajectory around a possibly moving center.
  * [Jump movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_jump_movement.html): An illusion of jump above a baseline.
  * [Pixel movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_pixel_movement.html): A trajectory described pixel by pixel.



This page desribes the methods and callbacks common to all movement types.

Movements can be applied in-game to [map entities](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html), but also outside a game, typically in a [menu](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html) to move a [sprite](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_sprite.html), an [image](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_surface.html) or just an `(x,y)` value. However, some properties of movements (like [movement:set_ignore_obstacles()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_movement.html#lua_api_movement_set_ignore_obstacles)) only take effect in the case of a [map entity](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html) because they refer to [map-specific](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html) notions like obstacles.

Depending on the movement type, several methods are then available to get and set its properties.

  * `movement_type` (string): Type of movement to create. Must be one of:
    * `"straight"`: Follows a rectilinear trajectory.
    * `"random"`: Like "straight" but with random, changing angles.
    * `"target"`: Like "straight" but goes into the direction of a fixed point or a moving entity.
    * `"path"`: Follows a specified succession of basic moves on an 8x8 pixels grid.
    * `"random_path"`: Like "path" but computes the path randomly.
    * `"path_finding"`: Like "path" but computes the shortest path to an entity, avoiding obstacles of the map (only possible in game).
    * `"circle"`: Follows a circular trajectory around a center.
    * `"jump"`: Makes a jump above a rectilinear trajectory.
    * `"pixel"`: Follows a trajectory specified pixel by pixel.
  * Return value (movement): The movement created. See the sections below to know the get and set methods available for your movement type.

Sets the scaling factor of this shader.

The scaling factor indicates how much the input texture will be scaled by the shader when the shader is applied to the window.

This value only has an effect when the shader is applied to the window (with [sol.video.set_shader()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_video.html#lua_api_video_set_shader)), and does nothing when the shader is applied to a drawable object (with [drawable:set_shader()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_drawable.html#lua_api_drawable_set_shader)).

If no value is set (the default), then the output texture of the shader will directly have the size of the window. If a value is set, then the output texture of the shader will have the size of the input texture multiplied by this scaling factor (however, that output texture will then be scaled a second time to fit to the actual window). This is only useful for scaling shaders.

Sets a uniform value to this shader.

Uniforms are input values to shader programs that are constant for all vertices and pixels during one rendering frame. Solarus automatically sets some uniform variables for you if you define them in the shader (see the [built-in variables](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_shader.html#lua_api_shader_overview_built_in_variables) section above).

Use this function if you want to pass additional uniform values.

The type of the uniform in your shader source code will depend on the Lua type you pass here:

  * A `boolean:` should be declared as `bool` in the shader.
  * A `number:` should be declared as `float` in the shader.
  * An array of two `number`s: should be declared as `vec2` in the shader.
  * An array of three `number`s: should be declared as `vec3` in the shader.
  * An array of four `number`s: should be declared as `vec4` in the shader.
  * A [surface](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_surface.html): should be declared as `sampler2D` in the shader.



If the shader has no uniform with the given name, then this method does nothing.

  * `uniform_name` (string): Name of the uniform in your shader program.
  * value (boolean, number, table or surface): The value to set. If it is a table, it should be an array of 2, 3 or 4 numbers.



Remarks
    If the value is a [surface](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_surface.html), it is passed by reference. This means that if you modify the surface later, the shader with automatically have its updated content.

To display various information such as a title screen, a dialog box, a HUD (head-up display) or a pause screen, you can use one or several menus.

A menu is an arbitrary Lua table. A menu belongs to a context that may be the current [map](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html), the current [game](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html), the [sol.main](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html) table or even another menu. This context is the lifetime of your menu. As long as your menu is active, the engine will call events that are defined in your table, i.e. callback methods like [menu:on_started()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html#lua_api_menu_on_started) [menu:on_draw()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html#lua_api_menu_on_draw), [menu:on_key_pressed()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html#lua_api_menu_on_key_pressed), etc., to notify your menu of something (the player pressed a key, your menu needs to be redrawn, etc.).

This menu API does not provide anything fundamental: indeed, the [map](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html), [game](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html) and [sol.main](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html) APIs already provide the necessary features, so you could do what you want from there manually. But the API described on this page makes your life easier because menus automatically receive events whenever they need to be notified, and automatically stop being active when their context no longer exists.

For all keyboard, joypad and mouse events, menus are notified from the front one to the back one. For example, if some dialog box is shown during the pause menu and appears above that pause menu, it will naturally receive keyboard and joypad events first.

When a menu handles the event, it should return `true` to make the event stop being propagated. Menus (and other objects) below it won't be notified then. On the contrary, if no script has handled the event, then the engine can handle it with a built-in behavior.

Timers allow you to call a function in the future with a specified delay.

Here is a first example of use:
    
    
    -- Play sound "secret" in one second.
    local function play_secret_sound()
      sol.audio.play_sound("secret")
    end
    
    sol.timer.start(1000, play_secret_sound)
    

Shorter version to do the same thing:
    
    
    -- Equivalent code using an anonymous function.
    sol.timer.start(1000, function()
      sol.audio.play_sound("secret")
    end)
    

You can repeat a timer by returning `true` from your function:
    
    
    -- Call a function every second.
    sol.timer.start(1000, function()
      sol.audio.play_sound("danger")
      return true  -- To call the timer again (with the same delay).
    end)
    

To make a timer that repeats itself 10 times, just return `false` after 10 calls:
    
    
    -- Call a function ten times, with one second between each call.
    local num_calls = 0
    sol.timer.start(1000, function()
      sol.audio.play_sound("danger")
      num_calls = num_calls + 1
      return num_calls < 10
    end)
    

It is possible to restrict the lifetime of a timer to a context, like the game, the map or an enemy:
    
    
    -- Enemy that shoots a fireball every 5 seconds until it is killed.
    sol.timer.start(your_enemy, 5000, function()
      sol.audio.play_sound("attack_fireball")
      map:create_enemy(...)  -- Code that creates the fireball.
      return true  -- Repeat the timer.
    end)
    

Setting the context to an enemy ensures that when the enemy is killed, the timer is canceled. Otherwise, the callback function would still be called: in this example, you would hear the `"attack_fireball"` sound and the fireball would be created even if the enemy is killed in the meantime.

A sprite is an animated image. It is managed by an animation set. The animation set defines which animations are available and describes, for each animation, a sequence of images in each direction.

A sprite has the following properties:

  * a current animation from its animation set (like `"walking"` or `"hurt"`),
  * a current direction that indicates where the sprite is facing,
  * a current frame: the index of the current individual image in the sequence.



The animation set of a sprite is composed of one or several PNG images that store all the frames, and a data file that describes how frames are organized in the PNG images. The data file also indicates the delay to make between frames when animating them and other properties like whether the animation should loop. See the [sprites syntax](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/quest_sprite_data_file.html) for more information about the format of sprites.

We describe here the Lua API that you can use to show sprites during your game or your menus.

A target movement goes towards a target point. The target point can be a fixed point of an [entity](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html) of the [map](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html). If the target is a moving map entity, the movement updates its angle to continue to go towards the entity. By default, the target is the [hero](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html) when a [game](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html) is running.

This type of movement can be seen as a particular case of the [straight movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_straight_movement.html#lua_api_straight_movement_methods) type, where the angle is set automatically to go towards the target.

Remarks
    This type of movement goes straight towards the target. If you set the `smooth` property to `true`, it will try to avoid simple obstacles by moving to a side. This is usually enough for simple enemies that target the hero. If you want a more complex technique that calculates an intelligent path to the target, see the [path finding movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_path_finding_movement.html) type.

pixel_movement = {

  description = [[

A pixel movement makes a succession of basic translations, where each translation is a pixel-precise specified move (for example `(+2,-1)`). Each translation is immediate.

Unlike most other types of movements, there is no notion of speed in pixels per seconds. That's because a translation can transport the object instantly to another place - the movement is not necessarily continuous. Instead, you can set the delay between each translation.

Remarks
    Pixel movements are not often needed. Most of the time, you don't want to specify pixel-by-pixel trajectories. Higher-level types of movements like [path movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_path_movement.html#lua_api_path_movement_methods) or [target movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_target_movement.html#lua_api_target_movement_methods) usually fit your needs when you move [NPCs](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_npc.html) or [enemies](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html).

If you need to move an [enemy](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html) of the map, a [sprite](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_sprite.html) in a menu or simply an arbitrary point, you can create a movement object and set its properties. There are several types of movements. They differ by the kind of trajectory they can make. When you create a movement, you obtain a value of the movement type you chose. Then, to get and set its properties (like the speed, the angle, etc.), a movement object has several methods available. As detailed below, the methods available differ depending on the movement type because all movement types don't have the same properties.

The following movement types are available.

  * [Straight movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_straight_movement.html): Rectilinear trajectory in any direction.
  * [Random movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_random_movement.html): A straight movement whose direction changes randomly from time to time.
  * [Target movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_target_movement.html): Straight trajectory towards a possibly moving target.
  * [Path movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_path_movement.html): Predetermined path composed of steps in the 8 main directions.
  * [Random path movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_random_path_movement.html): Like a path movement, but with random steps.
  * [Path finding movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_path_finding_movement.html): Like a path movement, but calculated to reach a possibly moving target.
  * [Circle movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_circle_movement.html): Circular trajectory around a possibly moving center.
  * [Jump movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_jump_movement.html): An illusion of jump above a baseline.
  * [Pixel movement](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_pixel_movement.html): A trajectory described pixel by pixel.



This page desribes the methods and callbacks common to all movement types.

Movements can be applied in-game to [map entities](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html), but also outside a game, typically in a [menu](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html) to move a [sprite](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_sprite.html), an [image](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_surface.html) or just an `(x,y)` value. However, some properties of movements (like [movement:set_ignore_obstacles()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_movement.html#lua_api_movement_set_ignore_obstacles)) only take effect in the case of a [map entity](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html) because they refer to [map-specific](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html) notions like obstacles.
]],
  childs = {
    start = {
      type = "method",
      description = [[

Starts this movement on an object.

The movement will be applied until it finishes (if it has an end) or until it is replaced by another one. It does not matter if the movement gets out of scope in your Lua script.

  * `object_to_move` ([map entity](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html), [drawable object](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_drawable.html) or table): The object to move. It may be a map entity, a drawable object or a table with two fields `x` and `y`. In the case of the table, if the fields `x` and `y` don't exist, they are created and initialized to `0`.

An empty table will be initialized with `{x = 0, y = 0}`.

  * `callback` (function, optional): A function to call when the movement finishes.



Remarks
    The [hero](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html) is a [map entity](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html) just like any other. So you can apply a custom movement to him using this function. The usual way to do this is to call [hero:freeze()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html#lua_api_hero_freeze) first to properly remove control from the player, and then to start the movement. When you have finished, you can restore the control with [hero:unfreeze()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html#lua_api_hero_unfreeze). Indeed, changing the movement while the hero is in a state other than `"frozen"` might give surprising results. Your movement will be applied, replacing any built-in movement of the state, but whatever was happening in the state will still continue. Furthermore, your movement will disappear as soon as the state changes. So don't start a movement on the hero during an arbitrary state unless you know what you are doing.

Only possible when the game is running.

  * Return value (boolean): `true` if a dialog is being shown.

      type = "method",
      description = [[

Starts showing a dialog.

A dialog must not be already active. This function returns immediately, but you can provide a callback that will be executed when the dialog finishes. The game is suspended during the dialog, like when it is paused.

If the event [game:on_dialog_started()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_on_dialog_started) is not defined, then the engine will show a default, minimal dialog system without decoration. The user will be able to close the dialog by pressing the action command (you don't need to call [game:stop_dialog()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_stop_dialog)).

On the contrary, if the event [game:on_dialog_started()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_on_dialog_started) is defined, the engine calls it and does nothing else. This is the recommended way, because you can make your custom dialog box implementation with any feature you need. The game will be suspended until you call [game:stop_dialog()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_stop_dialog) explicitly.

  * `dialog_id` (string): Id of the dialog to show. The corresponding dialog must exist in the [dialogs.dat](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/quest_language_dialogs.html) file of the current [language](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_language.html).
  * `info` (any type, optional): Any information you want to pass to the [game:on_dialog_started()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_on_dialog_started) event. You can use this parameter to include in the dialog any information that is only known at runtime, for example the name of the player, the best score of a mini-game or the time spent so far in the game. See the examples below.
  * `callback` (function, optional): A function to be called when the dialog finishes. A status parameter (possibly `nil`) is passed to your function: its value is the argument of [game:stop_dialog()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_stop_dialog) and it represents the result of the dialog. This feature may be used by your dialog box system to return any useful information to the map script, like the answer chosen by the player if the dialog was a question, or whether the dialog was skipped.



Example of a small map script with an NPC that shows a simple dialog: 
    
    
    local map = ...
    
    function some_npc:on_interaction()
      -- Remember that you specify a dialog id, not directly the text to show.
      -- The text is defined in the dialogs.dat file of the current language.
      map:get_game():start_dialog("welcome_to_my_house")
    end
    

Here is a more complex example, with an NPC that asks a question. This example assumes that your dialog box system can ask questions to the player, and returns the answer as a boolean value passed to [game:stop_dialog()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_stop_dialog). 
    
    
    local map = ...
    local game = map:get_game()
    function another_npc:on_interaction()
      game:start_dialog("give_me_100_rupees_please", function(answer)
        if answer then
          if game:get_money() >= 100 then
            game:remove_money(100)
            game:start_dialog("thanks")
          else
            sol.audio.play_sound("wrong")
            game:start_dialog("not_enough_money")
          end
        else
          game:start_dialog("not_happy")
        end
      end)
    end
    

Finally, to illustrate the use of the `info` parameter, let's modify the previous example to make the amount of money only determined at runtime. In other words, we want an NPC that can say "Please give me 100 rupees", but also "Please give me 25 rupees" or any number. Since the number is only known at runtime, it can no longer be hardcoded in the text of the [dialog](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/quest_language_dialogs.html). So let's assume that the text of the dialog contains instead a special sequence (like `"$v"`) to be substituted by the final value. (Note that [shop treasures](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_shop_treasure.html#lua_api_shop_treasure_dialogs) use a very similar convention for their dialogs.) 
    
    
    local map = ...
    local game = map:get_game()
    
    function another_npc:on_interaction()
      local how_much = math.random(100)
      game:start_dialog("give_me_x_rupees_please", how_much, function(answer)
        if answer then
          if game:get_money() >= how_much then
            game:remove_money(how_much)
            -- ... The rest is unchanged.
    

To make this example work, you need a dialog box system that performs the substitution when `info` is set. See [game:on_dialog_started()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_on_dialog_started).

Note
    The `info` parameter of [game:start_dialog()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_start_dialog) and the status parameter of the callback are a flexible way to make the map script communicate with the dialog box system in both directions. They can been seen as the parameter and the result (respectively) of the dialog being displayed. They can both be any value, like a table with many information.
]],

      returns = "",
      valuetype = ""
      },
    stop_dialog = {
      type = "method",
      description = [[

Stops the current dialog.

A dialog must be active when you call this function. The dialog stops being displayed and the game can resume. This function is typically called by your dialog box system when it wants to close the dialog.

The [game:on_dialog_finished()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_on_dialog_finished) event is first called (if it is defined). Then, the callback that was passed to [game:start_dialog()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_start_dialog) is called (if it was defined) with the `status` argument.

  * `status` (any type, optional): Some information to return to the script that started the dialog. For example, you can pass the result of the dialog if it was a question, or whether it was skipped by the user before the end. See the [examples above](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_start_dialog).

If this event is not defined, the engine shows a minimal dialog box without decoration and you have nothing else to do.

If this event is defined, the engine does nothing and your script is responsible to show the dialog in any way you want, and to close it later by calling [game:stop_dialog()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_stop_dialog). It is recommended to implement your dialog system as a [menu](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html): if you do so, you will automatically get called by the engine when a command is pressed, when you need to draw the dialog box on the screen, etc.

    * `text` (string): Text of the dialog in the current language. It may have several lines. When it is not empty, it always ends with a newline character.

The table also contains all custom entries defined in [text/dialogs.dat](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/quest_language_dialogs.html) for this dialog. These custom entries always have string keys and string values. Values that were defined as numbers in `"text/dialogs.dat"` are replaced in this table by their string representation, and values that were defined as booleans are replaced by the string `"1"` for `true` and `"0"` for `false`.

Called when a game-over sequence starts.

This event is called when the player's life reaches zero, as soon as the [hero](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html) is in a state that allows game-over. It is also called if you started a game-over sequence manually with [game:start_game_over()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_start_game_over).

If this event is not defined, there is no game-over sequence: the game restarts immediately, like if you called [game:start()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_start), and the full life of the player is restored.

If this event is defined, the engine does nothing except suspending the game. Your script is then responsible to show a game-over sequence in any way you want, and to call [game:stop_game_over()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_stop_game_over) once you have finished.

For instance, you may create a [dialog](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_start_dialog) that lets the player [restart the game](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_start) or [save](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_save) and [quit](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_main.html#lua_api_main_reset), or a [menu](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html) with more options.

Actually, it is not even required to restart or quit the game after your game-over sequence (even if this is the most common case). Indeed, you can also just resume the game. In this case, the game continues normally like if nothing happened.

  * `key` (string): Name of the raw key that was pressed.
  * `modifiers` (table): A table whose keys indicate what modifiers were down during the event. Possible table keys are `"shift"`, `"control"` and `"alt"`. Table values are `true`.
  * Return value (boolean): Indicates whether the event was handled. If you return `true`, the event won't be propagated to other objects. If you return `false` or nothing, the event will continue its propagation in this order: to the game [menus](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html) if any, to the current map (including its own menus if any), and then to the game commands.



If you handle the event, you should return `true` to make the event stop being propagated. The [menus](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html) of your game (if any) and the current map won't be not notified in this case. On the contrary, if neither your game, its menus nor the current map handle the event, then the engine handles it with a built-in behavior. This built-in behavior is to check whether a game command is mapped to the keyboard key that was pressed. If yes, the keyboard pressed event will be transformed into a game command pressed event (see [game:on_command_pressed()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_on_command_pressed)).

Remarks
    This event indicates the raw keyboard key pressed. If you want the corresponding character instead (if any), see [game:on_character_pressed()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_on_character_pressed). If you want the corresponding higher-level game command (if any), see [game:on_command_pressed()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_on_command_pressed).

  * `key` (string): Name of the raw key that was released.
  * `modifiers` (table): A table whose keys indicate what modifiers were down during the event. Possible table keys are `"shift"`, `"control"` and `"alt"`. Table values are `true`.
  * Return value (boolean): Indicates whether the event was handled. If you return `true`, the event won't be propagated to other objects. If you return `false` or nothing, the event will continue its propagation in this order: to the game [menus](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html) if any, to the current map (including its own menus if any), and then to the game commands.



If you handle the event, you should return `true` to make the event stop being propagated. The [menus](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_menu.html) of your game (if any) and the current map won't be not notified in this case. On the contrary, if neither your game, its menus nor the current map handle the event, then the engine handles it with a built-in behavior. This built-in behavior is to check whether a game command is mapped to the keyboard key that was released. If yes, the "keyboard released" event will be transformed into a "game command released" event (see [game:on_command_released()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_on_command_released)).

Remarks
    When a character key is pressed, two events are called: [game:on_key_pressed()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_on_key_pressed) (indicating the raw key) and [game:on_character_pressed()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_on_character_pressed) (indicating the utf-8 character). If your game needs to input text from the user, [game:on_character_pressed()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_on_character_pressed) is what you want because it considers the keyboard's layout and gives you international utf-8 strings.

An equipment item represents something that the player can obtain (one or more times, in various forms and with several variants) and possibly keep. The Lua item type described in this page provides various functions to

  * get and the possession state of a equipment item,
  * set its properties, like whether the item is saved and has an amount,
  * control its dynamic behavior, like what happens when the player uses this item (for items that can be used).



A Lua item object represents a kind of treasure, and not a particular instance of treasures. Individual treasures may then be represented as [pickable treasures](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_pickable.html), [chests](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_chest.html), [shop treasures](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_shop_treasure.html), and may be brandished by the [hero](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html). For example, multiple treasures of the kind `"rupee"` may exist at the same time during the [game](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html), but only one Lua item object manages them.

The script file `items/XXXX.lua` defines the item named `XXXX`. The corresponding Lua item object is passed as parameter of that script. Use the Lua notation `"..."` to get this parameter and store it into a regular variable.

Here is a basic example of script for the `rupee` item, an item whose only role is to increase the money of the player when he obtains a rupee. 
    
    
    -- First, we put the parameter into a variable called "rupee".
    -- (In Lua, the notation "..." refers to the parameter(s) of the script.)
    local rupee = ...
    
    -- Event called when the hero obtains a rupee treasure.
    function rupee:on_obtaining()
      self:get_game():add_money(1)  -- Increase the money of 1 unit.
    end
    

Remarks
    All item scripts are loaded when you create a [savegame](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html) object. Indeed, equipment items only exist in the context of a particular savegame. As shown in the example above, you can retrieve that savegame with [item:get_game()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_item.html#lua_api_item_get_game).
     A [sprite](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/quest_sprite_data_file.html) animation named `XXXX` must also exist in the sprite `entities/items`: it is used by the engine whenever it needs to draw your item on the [map](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html) (for example, when a [pickable treasure](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_pickable.html) of this kind is created on the map).

Sets the name of the animation that should represent the shadow of this item in the sprite `"entities/shadow"`.

When the engine needs to show a treasure representing your item, it sometimes also wants to display a shadow (in addition of the treasure's main sprite). For example, [pickable treasures](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_pickable.html) dropped by enemies normally have a shadow.

The default shadow animation is `"big"`. You should call this function at initialization time if your item sprite is larger or smaller than usual.

Remarks
    To draw a treasure, the engine relies on two sprites: the treasure's main sprite (`entities/item`) and the shadow's sprite (`entities/shadow`). Both sprites and their appropriate animations must exist so that treasures can be displayed correctly.

Returns the world name that was set on this map.

The world name is an optional property defined in the [map data file](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html#lua_api_map_overview_files). Worlds allow to group maps together. The world can be any arbitrary name. Maps that have the same world name are considered to be part of the same environment. For example, your map can be in a world named `"outside_world"`, `"dungeon_1"` or `"some_scary_cave"`. A map that has no world is always considered to be alone in its own environment.

The world property is used to decide when to set the starting location of the player (the place where he starts when loading his [savegame](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html)). By default, the starting location is automatically set by the engine when the world changes (not when the map changes). This can be changed by defining the "Save starting location" property of destinations, from the quest editor or from a script (with [destination:set_starting_location_mode()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_destination.html#lua_api_destination_set_starting_location_mode)).

Some other features may also rely on the world property, like the state of [crystal blocks](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_crystal_block.html). Their state persists between all maps of the current world and is reset when entering a map whose world is different.

Entity names are unique (two entities cannot exist on the map with the same name at the same time). The name is optional: some entities may have no name. In this case, you cannot access them from this function.

As a convenient feature, map entities can also be accessed directly through the environment of the [map script](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html#lua_api_map_overview_files).

Remarks
    Technical note for curious Lua experts: the mechanism that makes map entities directly accessible in the map script environment is lazy (it is implemented as an `__index` metamethod). Entities are imported to the Lua side only when your script requests them. If you have thousands of named entities in your map, you won't have thousands of useless objects living in Lua. Only the ones your script tries to access are imported.

    * `weight` (number, optional): Level of `"lift"` [ability](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_get_ability) required to lift the object. `0` allows the player to lift the object unconditionally. The special value `-1` means that the object can never be lifted. The default value is `0`.
    * `can_be_cut` (boolean, optional): Whether the hero can cut the object with the sword. No value means `false`.
    * `can_explode` (boolean, optional): Whether the object should explode when it is cut, hit by a weapon and after a delay when the hero lifts it. The default value is `false`.

    * `ground` (string, optional): Ground defined by this entity. The ground is usually `"wall"`, but you may set `"traversable"` to make the object traversable, or for example `"grass"` to make it traversable too but with an additional grass sprite below the hero. The default value is `"wall"`.
    * `enabled_at_start` (boolean, optional): Whether the entity should be initially enabled. The default value is `true`.
    * `properties` (table, optional): Additional user-defined properties. See [entity:set_properties()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_set_properties) for the specification.

    * `x` (number): X coordinate on the map.
    * `y` (number): Y coordinate on the map.
    * `treasure_name` (string, optional): Kind of treasure to place in the chest (the name of an [equipment item](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_item.html)). If this value is not set, then the chest will be empty. If the treasure is not obtainable when the hero opens the chest, it becomes empty.
    * `treasure_variant` (number, optional): Variant of the treasure (because some [equipment items](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_item.html) may have several variants). The default value is `1` (the first variant).
    * `treasure_savegame_variable` (string, optional): Name of the boolean value that stores in the [savegame](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html) whether this chest is open.

    * `opening_condition` (string, optional): The condition required to open the chest. Only for opening methods `"interaction_if_savegame_variable"` and `"interaction_if_item"`.
      * For opening method `"interaction_if_savegame_variable"`, it must be the name of a savegame variable. The [hero](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html) will be allowed to open the chest if this saved value is either `true`, an integer greater than zero or a non-empty string.
      * For opening method `"interaction_if_item"`, it must be the name of an [equipment item](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_item.html). The hero will be allowed to open the chest if he has that item and, for items with an amount, if the amount is greater than zero.
      * For the default opening method (`"interaction"`), this setting has no effect.
    * `opening_condition_consumed` (boolean, optional): Whether opening the chest should consume the savegame variable or the [equipment item](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_item.html) that was required. The default setting is `false`. If you set it to `true`, the following rules are applied when the [hero](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html) successfully opens the chest:
      * For opening method `"interaction_if_savegame_variable"`, the savegame variable that was required is reset to `false`, `0` or `""` (depending on its type).
      * For opening method is `"interaction_if_item"`, the equipment item that was required is removed. This means setting its [possessed variant](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_item.html#lua_api_item_set_variant) to `0`, unless it has an associated amount: in this case, the amount is decremented.
    * `cannot_open_dialog` (string, optional): Id of the dialog to show if the hero fails to open the chest. If you don't set this value, no dialog is shown.
    * `enabled_at_start` (boolean, optional): Whether the entity should be initially enabled. The default value is `true`.

      * For opening method is `"interaction_if_item"`, the equipment item that was required is removed. This means setting its [possessed variant](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_item.html#lua_api_item_set_variant) to `0`, unless it has an associated amount: in this case, the amount is decremented.
      * With other opening methods, this setting has no effect.

Called when the hero opens this chest.

Then, if you don't define this event, by default, the engine gives the treasure to the player (if there is no treasure, then nothing else happens and the hero is automatically unfrozen).

Your script can define this event to customize what happens. By calling [hero:start_treasure()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html#lua_api_hero_start_treasure), you can either give the chest's treasure or a treasure decided dynamically. Or you can do something else: show a dialog, play a sound, close the chest again, etc.

The hero is automatically frozen during the whole process of opening a chest. If you don't give him a treasure, then you have to unblock him explicitly by calling [hero:unfreeze()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html#lua_api_hero_unfreeze) when you want to restore control to the player.

This function is similar to [map:create_enemy()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html#lua_api_map_create_enemy) but the coordinates are relative to the current enemy, and the layer is the one of the current enemy by default.

  * `properties` (table): A table that describes all properties of the enemy to create. Its key-value pairs must be:
    * `name` (string, optional): Name identifying the entity. If the name is already used by another entity, a suffix (of the form `"_2"`, `"_3"`, etc.) will be automatically appended to keep entity names unique. No value means no name.
    * `layer` (number, optional): The layer, between [map:get_min_layer()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html#lua_api_map_get_min_layer) and [map:get_max_layer()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html#lua_api_map_get_max_layer). No value means the same layer as the current enemy.
    * `x` (number, optional): X coordinate on the map, relative to the current enemy. The default value is `0`.
    * `y` (number, optional): Y coordinate on the map, relative to the current enemy. The default value is `0`.
    * `direction` (number, optional): Initial direction of the enemy, between `0` (East) and `3` (South). The default value is `3`.
    * `breed` (string): Model of enemy to create.
    * `savegame_variable` (string, optional): Name of the boolean value that stores in the [savegame](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html) whether this enemy is dead. No value means that the enemy is not saved. If the enemy is saved and was already killed, then no enemy is created. Instead, its [pickable treasure](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_pickable.html) is created if it is a saved one.
    * `treasure_name` (string, optional): Kind of [pickable treasure](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_pickable.html) to drop when the enemy is killed (the name of an [equipment item](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_item.html)). If this value is not set, or corresponds to a [non obtainable](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_item.html#lua_api_item_is_obtainable) item, then the enemy won't drop anything.
    * `treasure_variant` (number, optional): Variant of the treasure (because some [equipment items](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_item.html) may have several variants). The default value is `1` (the first variant).
    * `treasure_savegame_variable` (string, optional): Name of the boolean value that stores in the [savegame](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html) whether the [pickable treasure](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_pickable.html) of this enemy was obtained. No value means that the state of the treasure is not saved. If the treasure is saved and the player already has it, then the enemy won't drop anything.
  * Return value (enemy or [pickable treasure](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_pickable.html)): The enemy created, except when it is a saved enemy that is already dead. In this case, if the enemy dropped a saved treasure that is not obtained yet, this [pickable treasure](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_pickable.html) is created and returned. Otherwise, `nil` is returned.



#  Events inherited from map entity

Events are callback methods automatically called by the engine if you define them.

Enemies are particular [map entities](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html). Therefore, they inherit all events from the type map entity.

See [Events of all entity types](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_events) to know these events.

#  Events of the type enemy

The following events are specific to enemies.

Called at each cycle while this enemy is alive.

Remarks
    As this function is called at each cycle, it is recommended to use other solutions when possible, like [timers](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_timer.html) and other events.

For example, the enemy has just been created, or it was just hurt or immobilized, or you called [enemy:restart()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_restart). If your enemy should move, this is the right place to create its movement.

[Timers](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_timer.html) associated to the enemy were automatically destroyed. Thus, you should also recreate them from this event.
]],

Called when a [sprite](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_sprite.html) of this enemy overlaps another enemy's sprite.

  * `other_enemy` (enemy): Another enemy.
  * `other_sprite` ([sprite](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_sprite.html)): A sprite of that other enemy.
  * `my_sprite` ([sprite](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_sprite.html)): A sprite of the current enemy.

      description = [[

Called when this enemy receives an attack with a custom effect.

This function is called if you have set [consequence of the attack](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_get_attack_consequence) to `"custom"`. You have to define what happens, for example hurting the enemy, making a special reaction, etc.

  * `attack` (string): The attack that was received: `"sword"`, `"thrown_item"`, `"explosion"`, `"arrow"`, `"hookshot"`, `"boomerang"` or `"fire"`. In the particular case of a `"sword"` attack, the sword state is stopped and the hero goes back to state `"free"`.
  * `sprite` ([sprite](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_sprite.html)): The sprite of this enemy that receives the attack, or `nil` if the attack does not come from a pixel-precise collision.



Remarks
    Instead of using this event and the attack consequence `"custom"`, you can now simply pass a callback parameter to [enemy:set_attack_consequence()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_set_attack_consequence) or to [enemy:set_attack_consequence_sprite()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_set_attack_consequence_sprite).

    on_hurt_by_sword = {
      type = "method",
      description = [[

Called when this enemy is successfully hurt by the sword of the hero.

You should define this event to customize the damage inflicted by the sword.

This event can only be called if the [reaction](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_get_attack_consequence) to the `"sword"` attack is hurting the enemy.

At this point, the enemy is in the state of being hurt. His hurting animation and sound have just started. This is a good time to remove some life points with [enemy:remove_life()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_remove_life).

By default, if you don't define this event, the enemy loses a number of life points computed as [his reaction to sword attacks](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_get_attack_consequence) multiplied by the sword [ability level](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_get_ability) of the hero, and doubled during a spin attack.

  * `hero` ([hero](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html)): The hero who used the sword.
  * `enemy_sprite` ([sprite](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_sprite.html)): The sprite of this enemy that was hit. You may use this information if your enemy has several sprites with different behaviors.

Called when this enemy is successfully hurt by any attack.

This event can only be called if the [reaction](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_get_attack_consequence) to the attack is hurting the enemy.

At this point, the enemy is in the state of being hurt. His hurting animation and sound have just started and he has just lost some life.

  * `attack` (string): The attack that was received: `"sword"`, `"thrown_item"`, `"explosion"`, `"arrow"`, `"hookshot"`, `"boomerang"`, `"fire"`, or `"script"`.



Remarks
    In the case of a `"sword"` attack, this event is called right after [enemy:on_hurt_by_sword()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_on_hurt_by_sword).

      valuetype = ""
      },
    on_dying = {
      type = "method",
      description = [[

Called when the enemy's life comes to `0`.

When the life comes to `0`, the movement of the enemy is stopped, its timers are stopped too, the dying animation starts and a sound is played. The details of the dying animation and the sound played depend on the [hurt style](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_set_hurt_style) property.

  * If the hurt style is `"enemy"` or `"monster"`, any sprite of the enemy is automatically removed and replaced by the sprite indicated by [enemy:get_dying_sprite_id()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_get_dying_sprite_id) if any (which is by default `"enemies/enemy_killed"`).
  * If the hurt style is `"boss"`, your sprites continue to exist and to play animation "hurt", while explosions appear on the enemy.



In all cases, the enemy will be removed from the map when the dying animation ends.

Remarks
    This event is called right after [enemy:on_hurt()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_on_hurt).

    on_dead = {

      description = [[

Called when the enemy's dying animation is finished.

At this point, the enemy no longer exists on the map. In other words, [enemy:exists()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_exists) returns `false`, trying to get the enemy from its name returns `nil`, and functions like [map:get_entities(prefix)](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html#lua_api_map_get_entities_count) won't find this enemy.

This means that you can safely use [map:has_entities(prefix)](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html#lua_api_map_has_entities) from `enemy:on_dead()` to detect when all enemies with a common prefix are dead.

      },
    on_attacking_hero = {
      type = "method",
      description = [[

Called when the [hero](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html) is successfully touched by this enemy.

This event is not called if the hero was protected by his shield, or if he currently cannot be hurt for some reason, like when he is already being hurt, when he is [temporarily invincible](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html#lua_api_hero_set_invincible), or when he is in a special [state](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html#lua_api_hero_get_state) like brandishing a treasure.

Your script can define this event to customize what bad things happen to the hero. If you define this event, the engine does absolutely nothing and lets you handle this.

If you don't define this event, the hero is hurt with the predefined behavior as follows. The hero goes to the state `"hurt"` where is pushed away from the enemy. He loses some life depending on the enemy's [damage](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_get_damage) property, and on the hero's [tunic](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_game.html#lua_api_game_get_ability) and on [hero:on_taking_damage()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html#lua_api_hero_on_taking_damage) if defined. Then, he recovers and his sprites blink for a while. During this short period, he is temporarily invincible.

  * `hero` ([hero](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html)): The hero being attacked.
  * `enemy_sprite` ([sprite](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_sprite.html)): The sprite of the enemy that caused the collision with the hero. You may use this information if your enemy has several sprites with different behaviors. This value is `nil` if the attack does not come from a sprite collision test (see [enemy:set_attacking_collision_mode()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html#lua_api_enemy_set_attacking_collision_mode)).



Remarks
    If you call [hero:start_hurt()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html#lua_api_hero_start_hurt_entity), you will obtain something equivalent to the default behavior. But if you don't, keep in mind that if the hero can still be hurt after your call, this event will continue to be called while there is a collision with the enemy. To avoid this, see for example [hero:set_invincible()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html#lua_api_hero_set_invincible) to make the hero temporarily invincible.

Registers a function to be called when your custom entity detects a collision when another entity.

  * `collision_mode` (string or function): Specifies what kind of collision you want to test. This may be one of:
    * `"overlapping"`: Collision if the [bounding box](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_get_bounding_box) of both entities overlap. This is often used when the other entity can traverse your custom entity.
    * `"containing"`: Collision if the bounding box of the other entity is fully inside the bounding box of your custom entity.
    * `"origin"`: Collision if the [origin point](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_get_origin) or the other entity is inside the bounding box of your custom entity.
    * `"center"`: Collision if the [center point](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_get_center_position) of the other entity is inside the bounding box of your custom entity.
    * `"facing"`: Collision if the [facing position](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_get_facing_position) of the other entity's bounding box is touching your custom entity's bounding box. Bounding boxes don't necessarily overlap, but they are in contact: there is no space between them. When you consider the bounding box of an entity, which is a rectangle with four sides, the facing point is the middle point of the side the entity is oriented to. This `"facing"` collision test is useful when the other entity cannot traverse your custom entity. For instance, if the other entity has direction "east", there is a collision if the middle of the east side of its bounding box touches (but does not necessarily overlap) your custom entity's bounding box. This is very often what you need, typically to let the hero interact with your entity when he is looking at it.
    * `"touching"`: Like `"facing"`, but accepts all four sides of the other entity's bounding box, no matter its direction.
    * `"sprite"`: Collision if a sprite of the other entity overlaps a sprite of your custom entity. The collision test is pixel precise.
    * A function: Custom collision test. The function takes your custom entity and then the other entity as parameters and should return `true` if there is a collision between them. This function will be called every time the engine needs to check collisions between your custom entity and any other entity.
  * `callback` (function): A function that will be called when the collision test detects a collision with another entity. This allows you to decide dynamically. This function takes your custom entity and then the other entity as parameters. If the collision test was `"sprite"`, both involved sprites are also passed as third and fourth parameters: the third parameter is the sprite of your custom entity, and the fourth parameter is the sprite of the other entity. This may be useful when your entities have several sprites, otherwise you can just ignore these additional sprite parameters.

An entity gets destroyed when you call [entity:remove()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_remove) or when the engine removes it (for example an [enemy](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html) that gets killed or a [pickable treasure](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_pickable.html) that gets picked up).

Returns the origin point of this entity, relative to the upper left corner of its [bounding box](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_get_bounding_box).

When an entity is located at some coordinates on the [map](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_map.html), the origin points determines what exact point of the entity's bounding box is at those coordinates. It is not necessarily the upper left corner of the entity's bounding box.

The default origin point depends on the type of entity. By convention, it is usually be the central point of contact between the entity and the soil. For most entities, including the [hero](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html), [enemies](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_enemy.html), [non-playing characters](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_npc.html) and [custom entities](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_custom_entity.html), the default origin point is `8, 13` as their default size is `16x16`. More generally, the convention is to have an origin point of `width / 2, height - 3`.

This origin point property allows entities of different sizes to have comparable reference points. Indeed, when two entities to be drawn in Y order overlap, the engine needs to determine which one has to be displayed first (it is always the one with the lowest Y coordinate). Using the upper left corner Y coordinate for this would not work well with entities of different sizes.

Similarly, if you need to compute an [angle](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_get_angle) between two entities to move an entity away from another one, the calculation uses the origin point of both entities. Using the upper left corner of their bounding box would not give the accurate angle with entities of different sizes.

The origin point is also the point of synchronization of an entity with its [sprites](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_sprite.html) (because again, an entity that has a given size may have sprites with different sizes).

  * Return value 1 (number): X coordinate of the origin point in pixels, relative to the upper left corner of the entity's bounding box.

    * `"overlapping"`: Collision if the [bounding box](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_get_bounding_box) of both entities overlap. This is the default value.

Bounding boxes don't necessarily overlap, but they are in contact: there is no space between them. When you consider the bounding box of an entity, which is a rectangle with four sides, the facing point is the middle point of the side the entity is oriented to. This `"facing"` collision test is useful when the other entity cannot traverse your custom entity. For instance, if the other entity has direction "east", there is a collision if the middle of the east side of its bounding box touches (but does not necessarily overlap) this entity's bounding box. This is typically what you need to let the hero interact with this entity when he is looking at it.
    * `"touching"`: Like `"facing"`, but accepts all four sides of the other entity's bounding box, no matter its direction.
    * `"sprite"`: Collision if a sprite of the other entity overlaps a sprite of this entity. The collision test is pixel precise. The last two optional sprite parameters can then indicate which sprite of both entities you want to test. If you don't set them, all sprites of both entities will be tested.
  * `entity_sprite` ([sprite](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_sprite.html) or nil, optional): Sprite of this entity you want to test (only with collision mode `"sprite"`). `nil` or no value means to test all sprites of this entity.

Returns whether this entity should be drawn in Y order or in Z order.

The map is drawn layer by layer, and each layer is drawn in two passes: first, entities displayed in Z order, and then, entities displayed in Y order.

The Z order is the creation order of entities unless you call [entity:bring_to_front()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_bring_to_front) or [entity:bring_to_back()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_bring_to_back).

The Y order compares the Y coordinate of entities on the map. Entities drawn in Y order are displayed from the one the most to the north to the one the most to the south.

Usually, entities representing a character or something that is standing should be drawn in Y order, so that it looks correct when some of them overlap with each other, and flat entities should be drawn in Z order.

The default setting depends on the type of entities.

To manage entities with multiple sprites, you can set names when you create sprites with [entity:create_sprite()](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_entity.html#lua_api_entity_create_sprite). However, it is easier to just leave the names blank and simply store the result of these sprite creation methods. The name is more useful for built-in entities that have multiple sprites automatically created by the engine. Such entities are the [hero](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_hero.html), [pickable treasures](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_pickable.html), [carried objects](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_carried_object.html) and [crystals](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_crystal.html).

Returns an iterator to all [sprites](http://www.solarus-games.org/doc/1.6/lua_api_sprite.html) of this entity.

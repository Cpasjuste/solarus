This is Solarus, the open-source A-RPG game engine.

This Windows player package contains:
- solarus-launcher.exe: The executable GUI of the engine. Run it and then select the
  quest to run and the options you want.
- solarus-run.exe: An executable file that directly runs a quest.
  Run it with the path of your quest as argument
  (the directory containing data/ or data.solarus or data.solarus.zip).
  Without this argument, the current directory is used as quest path.

See our website www.solarus-games.org for more information, to learn how to create
a quest or to download our games or the source code of the engine.

Enjoy!

local map = ...
local game = map:get_game()
local hero = map:get_hero()

-- Event called at initialization time, as soon as this map is loaded.
function map:on_started()

  -- You can initialize the movement and sprites of various
  -- map entities here.
end

-- Event called after the opening transition effect of the map,
-- that is, when the player takes control of the hero.
function map:on_opening_transition_finished()
  hero:start_bow()
  sol.timer.start(4000, function() sol.main.exit() end)
